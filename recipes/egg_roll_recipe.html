<br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3/4 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
            <li>3 cups coleslaw mix</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>12 egg roll wrappers</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium high heat. Add the ground pork and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook, breaking up the pork with a spatula, until meat is browned and cooked through. Add the garlic and ginger then cook for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir in the coleslaw mix and green onions. Cook until cabbage is wilted, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the soy sauce and sesame oil, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Spoon approximately 2-3 tablespoons of filling onto each egg roll wrapper and fold according to package directions, using the beaten egg to seal the edges of the wrappers as you go.</li>
            <li>Pour 2-3 inches of oil into a deep pot.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 350 degrees. Fry 3-4 egg rolls at a time, turning occasionally, until browned all over, approximately 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels, then serve with dipping sauce of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
